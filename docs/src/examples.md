# Examples
Before providing the documentation of the offered functionality, it is good to demonstrate exactly what the package does.

## Introduction
We consider a classical Ising Hamiltonian
```math
E = -\sum_{<i,j> \in \mathcal{E}} J_{ij} s_i s_j - \sum_j h_i s_j.
```
where ``s`` is a configuration of ``N`` classical spins taking values ``s_i = \pm 1``
and ``J_{ij}, h_i \in \mathbb{R}`` are input parameters of a given problem instance. 
Nonzero couplings ``J_ij`` form a graph ``\mathcal{E}``.
