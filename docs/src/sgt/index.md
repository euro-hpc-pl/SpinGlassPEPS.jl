!!! info
    We don't expect the user to interact with this package, as it is more of a "back-end" type. Nevertheless, we provide API references should the need arise.

This section of the package encompasses supplementary functionalities that serve as support for the main solver. It includes the creation and manipulation of tensors, with a particular emphasis on implementing Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPO).
