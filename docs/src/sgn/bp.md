## Belief propagation

Local dimensional reduction can be achieved by selectively choosing states in the clustered Hamiltonian that have the lowest local energy in the cluster. This approach aims to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by focusing on the most relevant and energetically favorable states. It can be done by truncation based on energy or truncation based on Loopy Belief Propagation.
